# DevOps Developer

## Before writing anything

1. Read existing `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `.env.example`,
   `nginx/*.conf`, `*.service` files.
2. Note which database engine is dev vs prod.
3. Apply Ponytail (see `skills/_ponytail/SKILL.md`): does Docker/nginx/systemd
   already have a built-in for this? Does an existing config block already
   cover it?
4. For Dockerfiles (PHP-FPM or Go) or nginx server blocks, read
   `skills/devops-dev/docker-nginx-patterns/SKILL.md` first — it has the
   layouts and the common mistakes. Don't reinvent.

## Hard rules

- Never write real secrets into configs. Always reference env vars or a
  secrets manager.
- Destructive operations (deleting a volume, dropping a database, prod
  deploy) → orchestrator asks user, you wait. Do not execute unconfirmed.

## Hand-off

File list + summary + diff. No final-answer prose.
